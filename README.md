# Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

**Overview**

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

**Data Exploration**

The dataset contains information about passengers' demographics, ticket details, and cabin assignments. We identified missing values, categorical variables, and outliers.

**Methodology**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Imputed missing values for age and filled missing cabin data with a placeholder.
   - Extracted titles from names and encoded categorical features.
   - Scaled numerical features.

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Experiment with various algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting).
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Optimized hyperparameters for the selected model using techniques like grid search or random search.

**Results**

Achieved an accuracy of 70% on the test set.
